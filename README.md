## About this Package?

Implementing a main menu often forces you to go through it every time you test your game. Switching between your target scene and the main menu repeatedly can **break your workflow**.

The **Autostart** tool (aka **Playmode Start Scene**) solves this problem by letting you **assign any scene as the default play mode start scene**. Hit play, and Unity automatically loads that scene - no matter which scene you are currently editing.

## Features

✔️ **Set any scene as the default play mode start scene**    
✔️ **Automatically loads your chosen scene** when hitting play    
✔️ **Toggle feature on/off directly from Unity’s toolbar** for flexible workflows    
✔️ Minimizes friction and lets you **focus on building your game**, not fighting the editor
