## About this Package?

Losing unsaved progress after a crash is frustrating - hitting Save every few seconds is just annoying. While Unity does autoamtically save your general project, it does not save the scene you are currently working on. The Autosave tool handles this for you, keeping your work safe automatically.

To give you even more control, it includes a versioning mode, which saves backups with timestamps instead of overwriting the active scene. This allows you to roll back to earlier versions whenever needed.
